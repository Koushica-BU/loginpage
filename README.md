# Hi, I am Koushica

Welcome to my repository!

## About Me
I enjoy learning in a practical way. This repository is created for learning purposes, specifically focusing on building a basic login page using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple login page with:

- A form with fields for the username and password.
- Basic styling to enhance the user interface.

## Getting Started
To view and use the login page, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```
git clone https://github.com/Koushica-BU/loginpage.git
cd loginpage
open index.html
```

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML code for the login page.
- `styles.css`: Contains the basic CSS code for the login page.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
